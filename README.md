# InternshipQuestion
OVERVIEW
We need your help! Datahouse is looking to add new members to its team but needs your
amazing development skills to make the right decision. Your task, should you choose to accept it,
will be to build an application that takes an input: an array of applicants and an array of team
members, and produces an output: an array of applicants with their respective compatibility
score. How the compatibility score is generated is up to you. Help us make the right decision!

SPECIFICATIONS
- Input and Output must be in JSON
- Compatibility score for each applicant should fall in a range from [0, 1]
- Use any programming language you wish to develop in.

This program takes a JSON file as input. It reads the contents of the JSON file in order to find the applicants and their attributes. It uses said attributes in the JSON file to calculate the total score of each attribute. It then outputs the values in a JSON file. Examples of the input and output JSON files have been uploaded.
